Kiran Manu Sam

I am a Senior Associate in Data Analytics team of Sapientâ€™s Gurgaon office. I am an MBA graduate with a major in Marketing. Before pursuing my MBA, I was working in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for 3 years.

I collect, cleanse and provide modeling and analyses of structured and unstructured data used for major business initiatives.

I make decision making an absolute pleasure and make it convenient for the clients, stakeholders and the top decision makers to follow the best course of action by slicing and dicing the data and make Machine Learning models whose results are displayed in attracive dashboards.
